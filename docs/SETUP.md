# Installation
There are multiple ways to install this application and configure it.

## Releases (Recommended)
We recommend installing this application through the releases section. We also highly recommend installing the **Latest** version rather than the **Pre-Release** version; features within the **Pre-Release** version may not be working as intended and some, may not be fully tested.

### Pre Requisites
- Windows (Home/Pro) 10/11 *or* Windows Server 2019, 2022
- Arma Reforger Server.
    - Battleye RCON must be configured and working.

### Install
- Find the latest download in the [releases section](https://github.com/BreathXV/ReforgerWhitelistPy/releases) of the GitHub Repository.
- Download the latest release by selecting **Assets** and clicking on the file `ReforgerWhitelist.exe` which will begin the install into your **Downloads** folder.
- At this stage, your **Anti-Virus**, even your browser and, including third-party applications such as **VirusTotal** will flag this file as *dangerous and/or malicious*. Ignore these messages and continue with the installation.
- Now that you have it installed, it should be in your **Downloads** folder, it may be in a zipped folder. You can use many third-party tools such as *WinRar* or, you may have the ability to *right-click* on the selected zipped folder and *Extract All*; this will place an un-zipped folder in your **Downloads** directory.

### Configuration
There are three ways to configure the application, using the [config.example.json](https://github.com/BreathXV/ReforgerWhitelistPy/blob/dev/config.example.json), using command-line arguments or, using a *PowerShell* script.

#### Configuration File (Recommended)
- Copy over the [config.example.json](https://github.com/BreathXV/ReforgerWhitelistPy/blob/dev/config.example.json) to your PC and, change the file name from `config.example.json` to `config.json`. 
- Now, you'll want to open the `config.json` file with a text editor such as **Notepad++** or **Notepad**.
